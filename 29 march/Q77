// 77. Write a C program that accepts principal amount, rate of interest and days for a loan and calculates the simple interest for the loan, using the following formula. Go to the editor
// interest = principal * rate * days / 365.
// Sample Input:
// 10000
// .1
// 365
// 0
// Sample Output:
// Input loan amount (0 to quit): Input interest rate: Input term of the loan in days: The interest amount is $1000.00
// Input loan principal_amt (0 to quit):

#include <stdio.h>
int main()
{
    int principal,rate,days,interest;
    
    while(1){
    
    printf("\nInput loan amount or (0 to quit) = ");
    scanf("%d", &principal);
    if (principal==0){
        break;
    }
   
   printf("take input as rate of interest = ");
   scanf("%d", &rate);
   printf("take input as number of days = ");
   scanf("%d", &days);
   
    interest = principal * rate * days / 365;
    printf("The interest amount is $%d\n", interest);
    
    
    }
    
    return 0;
